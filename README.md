## Frequency-Specific Resting-State MEG Networks Differentiate Tinnitus Patients from Healthy Controls

Tinnitus, defined as the perception of sound without an external source, affects a substantial portion of the population and can cause significant individual suffering. However, understanding the altered brain connectome in tinnitus remains limited.
Traditionally, Pearson correlation or techniques such as the phase lag index (PLI) and coherence between regional time-courses are employed as pairwise measures for determining each edge weight of the human brain functional connectome. 
Building on recent advancements in graph signal processing, we proposed estimating the entire graph structure by simultaneously considering all time-courses and demonstrated that method is robust even for short-duration recordings.
Using resting-state MEG recordings from both control subjects and tinnitus individuals, we first demonstrated the superior performance of these learned brain graphs over correlation-based functional connectomes in individual fingerprinting.
Then, through group comparisons, we identified regional connections that statistically differ between controls and tinnitus individuals. Notably, we observed that individual functional connectivity profiles remain both unique and highly heterogeneous in tinnitus. 
Finally, we highlighted the specific patterns that distinguish tinnitus individuals, revealing a reconfiguration of their brain fingerprints.
These findings underscore the necessity of shifting the research focus from group-level differences to individual variability in tinnitus studies. Individual functional connectomes hold the potential to pave the way for personalized medicine by aiding in the development of patient-specific tinnitus models, improving prediction accuracy, and optimizing treatment strategies.
