## Frequency-Specific Cortical Connectivity in Tinnitus via Graph Learning

Tinnitus, defined as the perception of sound without an external source, affects a substantial portion of the population and can cause significant individual suffering. However, the understanding of the altered brain connectome in tinnitus remains limited.

Traditionally, the Pearson correlation or techniques such as the phase lag index (PLI) and Coherence between regional time-courses are employed as pairwise measures for determining each edge weight of the human brain functional connectome. 
Building on recent advancements in graph signal processing, we proposed estimating the entire graph structure by simultaneously considering all time-courses.
Using resting-state MEG recordings from both control subjects and individuals with tinnitus, we first demonstrated the superior performance of these learned brain graphs over correlation-based functional connectomes in individual characterization.
Then by comparing the two groups, the regional connections that statistically differ between them were highlighted.
Understanding the altered connections in tinnitus could be essential for developing more accurate neural features for neurofeedback in tinnitus research and treatment.
